See exactly where your context window goes. Trace every agent delegation. Understand how your Claude Code workflows actually execute — all from your local `~/.claude`, no data sent anywhere.

Now tracks both **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex CLI** sessions side by side: when `~/.codex` is present, Codex sessions show up alongside your Claude sessions across the list, detail, stats, and cost views.

```bash
npx claude-session-dashboard
```

## Why?

If you run Claude Code with agentic workflows and custom skills, you've probably felt this: sessions that start sharp and gradually get worse. Claude repeating itself, missing earlier context, giving shallower answers. The context window is filling up silently and you have no way to see it.

The fix is agent delegation — each subagent starts with a fresh context, keeping your main session lean. But most people do this by instinct, not by design. You can't optimize what you can't see.

This dashboard makes it visible. It reads your local session files, parses the JSONL logs, and shows you what's actually happening inside your workflows — which agents were dispatched, in what order, how much context each step consumed, and where your tokens are going.

Everything runs entirely on your machine. Read-only — it never modifies any Claude Code data.

## Features

**Agent delegation timeline** ← the unique one
- Gantt-style diagram showing every subagent dispatch in a session, in sequence
- See the full delegation chain: which agents ran, in what order, how long each took
- Token usage per agent — understand exactly how each delegation affects context consumption
- Zoom controls for detailed inspection of complex multi-agent workflows

**Context window visualization**
- Live breakdown of how your 200K context window is being used: input, output, cache reads, cache writes
- See at a glance whether your main session is staying lean or accumulating context
- Per-session and per-agent cost estimates with per-model and per-category breakdowns

**Session browsing and search**
- Full-text search across session names, projects, and branches
- Filter by status (active / completed), project, model, and date range
- Sortable columns with pagination
- Active session indicator with real-time status polling

**Analytics and stats**
- GitHub-style contribution heatmap showing token usage intensity over the past year
- Token usage over time -- stacked area chart with daily/weekly toggle, top 5 models + "Other"
- Model usage distribution across all sessions
- Hourly activity distribution chart
- Aggregate metrics: total sessions, messages, tokens, estimated cost

![Stats Overview](screenshots/stats-overview-full.png)

**Per-project analytics**
- Dedicated "Projects" tab with sortable table
- Sessions, messages, tokens, and duration aggregated per project
- Drill-down links to filtered session lists

**Cost estimation**
- Configurable API pricing per model (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4, Haiku, etc.)
- Subscription tier support (Free, Pro, Max 5x/20x) with appropriate rate adjustments
- Settings persisted to `~/.claude-dashboard/settings.json`

![Settings Page](screenshots/settings-page.png)

**Data export**
- Export stats and session data in CSV or JSON format
- Four export formats: session summaries, model usage, daily activity, project analytics
- Client-side export -- no server round-trip needed

**Real-time monitoring**
- Active sessions badge in the sidebar with 3-second status polling
- Active session banner on detail pages with adaptive refresh intervals
- Automatic data refresh for in-progress sessions

**Privacy mode**
- Toggle to anonymize project names, file paths, branch names, and usernames
- Analytics data anonymized consistently across all views
- Safe for screenshot sharing and presentations

## Quick Start

### Using npx (recommended)

```bash
npx claude-session-dashboard
```

### Using npm (global install)

```bash
npm install -g claude-session-dashboard
claude-dashboard
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dlupiak/claude-session-dashboard.git
cd claude-session-dashboard/apps/web
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Updating

**npx** — always fetches the latest published version automatically. No action needed.

**Global install** — check your current version and update:

```bash
claude-dashboard --version           # see current version
npm install -g claude-session-dashboard@latest
```

**From source** — pull the latest changes and rebuild:

```bash
cd claude-session-dashboard
git pull
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build
```

## CLI Options

```
  -p, --port <number>   Port to listen on (default: 3000)
  --host <hostname>     Host to bind to (default: localhost)
  -o, --open            Open browser after starting
  -v, --version         Show version number
  -h, --help            Show this help message
```

> **Note:** The dashboard runs entirely on localhost and only reads files from `~/.claude`. It never modifies any Claude Code data and never sends data over the network.

```

## How It Works

1. **Scanning** -- The server reads `~/.claude/projects/` to discover all session `.jsonl` files. An mtime-based cache avoids re-parsing unchanged files.
2. **Parsing** -- Session files are parsed to extract metadata (project, branch, duration, model), tool calls, agent dispatches, token usage, and errors.
3. **Server Functions** -- TanStack Start server functions (`createServerFn`) expose parsed data to the client via type-safe RPC. All file I/O stays on the server.
4. **React Query** -- The UI fetches data through React Query with automatic background refetch for live updates. Active sessions use adaptive polling intervals.
5. **Caching** -- Parsed session summaries and heatmap data are cached in memory (mtime-based invalidation) and on disk (`~/.claude-dashboard/cache/`) for fast startup.
